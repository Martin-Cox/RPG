Character:

Get the characters quantity for a given magic
Stats should be out of 255
Player magic quantity can go up to 255, stats are modified only by the 1st 100, so player is free to use the remaining 155 without worrying about losing stats


Affinities:
e.g. to get magic bonus = magicBaseDamage * ((magStat/100 + elementalAffinity/100) + 1.00)


Using Magic
e.g. Cure at low level = 200 * ((0.6 + 0.00) + 1.00) =  320hp

e.g Cure at max level = 200 * ((2.55 + 2.55) + 1.00) = 1220hp


Misc:
- Use int for performance reason unless value can be null, in which case use Integer
